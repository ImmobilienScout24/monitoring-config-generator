# this file demonstrates, how defaults and variables interact:
# - first defaults are applied
# - then variables are replaced


# we have to have a host_name in each section
# else the generated icinga config will not pass the sanity check
# so we define a host_name as default here
defaults:
    check_command: 1
    check_interval: 2
    check_period: 3
    host_name: testhost06
    max_check_attempts: 4
    notification_interval: 5
    notification_period: 6
    retry_interval: 7
    y: ${x}    

variables:
    x: "42"

#   this should become y = blah42, cause default will not apply here, but var will still be replaced
host:
    y: blah${x}

services:
#   this should become y=42 obviously
  service1:
     service_description: service1

#   this should become x=23 and y=42, cause attribute x is independent of variable x
  service2:
     service_description: service2
     x: 23
